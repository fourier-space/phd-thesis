abstract = {With a conventional lens sharpness of the image is always limited by the wavelength of light. An unconventional alternative to a lens, a slab of negative refractive index material, has the power to focus all Fourier components of a 2D image, even those that do not propagate in a radiative manner. Such ``superlenses{\{}''{\}} can be realized in the microwave band with current technology. Our simulations show that a version of the lens operating at the frequency of visible light can be realized in the form of a thin slab of silver. This optical version resolves objects only a few nanometers across.},

@article{Zhang2005a,
abstract = {Recently, the concept of superlensing has received considerable attention for its unique ability to produce images below the diffraction limit. The theoretical study has predicted a 'superlens' made of materials with negative permittivity and/or permeability, is capable of resolving features much smaller than the working wavelength and a near-perfect image can be obtained through the restoration of lost evanescent waves (Pendry 2000 Phys. Rev. Lett. 85 3966–9). We have already demonstrated that a 60 nm half-pitch object can indeed be resolved with $\lambda$ 0 /6 resolution with the implementation of a silver superlens with $\lambda$ 0 = 365 nm illumination wavelength, which is well below the diffraction limit (Fang et al 2005 Science 308 534–7). In order to further support the imaging ability of our silver superlens, a two-dimensional arbitrary object with 40 nm line width was also imaged (Fang et al 2005 Science 308 534–7). In this paper, we present experimental and theoretical investigations of optical superlensing through a thin silver slab. Experimental design and procedures as well as theoretical studies are presented in detail. In addition, a new superlens imaging result is presented which shows the image of a 50 nm half-pitch object at $\lambda$ 0 /7 resolution.},

abstract = {We have recently shown that graphene is unsuitable to replace metals in the current-carrying elements of metamaterials. At the other hand, experiments have demonstrated that a layer of graphene can modify the optical response of a metal-based metamaterial. Here we study this electromagnetic interaction between metamaterials and graphene. We show that the weak optical response of graphene can be modified dramatically by coupling to the strong resonant fields in metallic structures. A crucial element determining the interaction strength is the orientation of the resonant fields. If the resonant electric field is predominantly parallel to the graphene sheet (e.g., in a complementary split-ring metamaterial), the metamaterial's resonance can be strongly damped. If the resonant field is predominantly perpendicular to the graphene sheet (e.g., in a wire-pair metamaterial), no significant interaction exists.},

Here, we propose to use graphene plasmons as a platform for strongly enhanced light-matter interactions. Specifically, we predict unprecedented high decay rates of quantum emitters in the proximity of a carbon sheet, observable vacuum Rabi splittings, and extinction cross sections exceeding the geometrical area in graphene nanoribbons and nanodisks. Our theoretical results provide the basis for the emerging and potentially far-reaching field of graphene plasmonics, offering an ideal platform for cavity quantum electrodynamics, and supporting the possibility of single-molecule, single-plasmon devices.},

@article{Vlasov2005,
abstract = {It is known that light can be slowed down in dispersive materials near resonances. Dramatic reduction of the light group velocity-and even bringing light pulses to a complete halt-has been demonstrated recently in various atomic and solid state systems, where the material absorption is cancelled via quantum optical coherent effects. Exploitation of slow light phenomena has potential for applications ranging from all-optical storage to all-optical switching. Existing schemes, however, are restricted to the narrow frequency range of the material resonance, which limits the operation frequency, maximum data rate and storage capacity. Moreover, the implementation of external lasers, low pressures and/or low temperatures prevents miniaturization and hinders practical applications. Here we experimentally demonstrate an over 300-fold reduction of the group velocity on a silicon chip via an ultra-compact photonic integrated circuit using low-loss silicon photonic crystal waveguides that can support an optical mode with a submicrometre cross-section. In addition, we show fast (approximately 100 ns) and efficient (2 mW electric power) active control of the group velocity by localized heating of the photonic crystal waveguide with an integrated micro-heater.},

abstract = {The ability to detect light over a broad spectral range is central to several technological applications in imaging, sensing, spectroscopy and communication. Graphene is a promising candidate material for ultra-broadband photodetectors, as its absorption spectrum covers the entire ultraviolet to far-infrared range. However, the responsivity of graphene-based photodetectors has so far been limited to tens of mA W(-1) (refs 5-10) due to the small optical absorption of a monolayer of carbon atoms. Integration of colloidal quantum dots in the light absorption layer can improve the responsivity of graphene photodetectors to ∼ 1 × 10(7) A W(-1) (ref. 11), but the spectral range of photodetection is reduced because light absorption occurs in the quantum dots. Here, we report an ultra-broadband photodetector design based on a graphene double-layer heterostructure. The detector is a phototransistor consisting of a pair of stacked graphene monolayers (top layer, gate; bottom layer, channel) separated by a thin tunnel barrier. Under optical illumination, photoexcited hot carriers generated in the top layer tunnel into the bottom layer, leading to a charge build-up on the gate and a strong photogating effect on the channel conductance. The devices demonstrated room-temperature photodetection from the visible to the mid-infrared range, with mid-infrared responsivity higher than 1 A W(-1), as required by most applications. These results address key challenges for broadband infrared detectors, and are promising for the development of graphene-based hot-carrier optoelectronic applications.},

abstract = {Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are electromagnetic (EM) modes propagating along metal-dielectric interfaces, in which surface collective excitations of free electrons in the metal are coupled to evanescent EM fields in the dielectric. Various SPP modes can be supported by flat and curved, single and multiple surfaces, exhibiting remarkable properties, including the possibility of concentrating EM fields beyond the diffraction limit, i.e. on the nanoscale, while enhancing local field strengths by several orders of magnitude. This unique feature of SPP modes, along with the ever-increasing demands for miniaturization of photonic components and circuits, generates an exponentially growing interest in SPP-mediated radiation guiding and SPP-based waveguide components. Here we review the current status of this rapidly developing field, starting with a brief presentation of the main planar SPP modes along with the techniques employed for their excitation and manipulation by sets of nanoparticles. We then describe in detail various SPP-based waveguide configurations that ensure two-dimensional mode confinement in the plane perpendicular to the propagation direction and compare their characteristics. Excitation of SPP waveguide modes and recent progress in the development of SPP-based waveguide components are also discussed, concluding with our outlook on challenges and possible future developments in this field.},

Plasmon emission provides another pathway that, as we show here, drives the carrier relaxation dynamics on ultrafast timescales. In studying the nonequilibrium relaxation dynamics we find that plasmon emission effectively converts inversion into hot carriers, whose energy is then extracted by optical phonon emission. This mechanism not only explains the observed fs-lifetime of inversion but also offers the prospect for atomically thin ultrafast plasmon emitters.},

We compare the validity of these methods and show that metallic losses can be greatly compensated by saturated gain. Two realizable applications are also proposed.

abstract = {Graphene is emerging as a viable alternative to conventional optoelectronic, plasmonic and nanophotonic materials. The interaction of light with charge carriers creates an out-of-equilibrium distribution, which relaxes on an ultrafast timescale to a hot Fermi-Dirac distribution, that subsequently cools emitting phonons. Although the slower relaxation mechanisms have been extensively investigated, the initial stages still pose a challenge. Experimentally, they defy the resolution of most pump-probe setups, due to the extremely fast sub-100 fs carrier dynamics. Theoretically, massless Dirac fermions represent a novel many-body problem, fundamentally different from Schr{\"{o}}dinger fermions. Here we combine pump-probe spectroscopy with a microscopic theory to investigate electron-electron interactions during the early stages of relaxation. We identify the mechanisms controlling the ultrafast dynamics, in particular the role of collinear scattering. This gives rise to Auger processes, including charge multiplication, which is key in photovoltage generation and photodetectors.},

abstract = {The extraordinary electronic properties of graphene provided the main thrusts for the rapid advance of graphene electronics. In photonics, the gate-controllable electronic properties of graphene provide a route to efficiently manipulate the interaction of photons with graphene, which has recently sparked keen interest in graphene plasmonics. However, the electro-optic tuning capability of unpatterned graphene alone is still not strong enough for practical optoelectronic applications owing to its non-resonant Drude-like behaviour. Here, we demonstrate that substantial gate-induced persistent switching and linear modulation of terahertz waves can be achieved in a two-dimensional metamaterial, into which an atomically thin, gated two-dimensional graphene layer is integrated. The gate-controllable light-matter interaction in the graphene layer can be greatly enhanced by the strong resonances of the metamaterial. Although the thickness of the embedded single-layer graphene is more than six orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength ({\textless}$\lambda$/1,000,000), the one-atom-thick layer, in conjunction with the metamaterial, can modulate both the amplitude of the transmitted wave by up to 47{\%} and its phase by 32.2° at room temperature. More interestingly, the gate-controlled active graphene metamaterials show hysteretic behaviour in the transmission of terahertz waves, which is indicative of persistent photonic memory effects.},

The graphene FETs fabricated on the plastic substrates showed a hole and electron mobility of 203 +/- 57 and 91 +/- 50 cm(2)/(V x s), respectively, at a drain bias of -1 V. Moreover, ion gel gated graphene FETs on the plastic substrates exhibited remarkably good mechanical flexibility.

abstract = {Long lifetimes of hot carriers can lead to qualitatively new types of responses in materials. The magnitude and time scales for these responses reflect the mechanisms governing energy flows. We examine the microscopics of two processes which are key for energy transport, focusing on the unusual behavior arising due to graphene's unique combination of material properties. One is hot carrier generation in its photoexcitation dynamics, where hot carriers multiply through an Auger type carrier–carrier scattering cascade. The hot-carrier generation manifests itself through elevated electronic temperatures which can be accessed in a variety of ways, in particular optical conductivity measurements. Another process of high interest is electron-lattice cooling. We survey different cooling pathways and discuss the cooling bottleneck arising for the momentum-conserving electron–phonon scattering pathway. We show how this bottleneck can be relieved by higher-order collisions—supercollisions—and examine the variety of supercollision processes that can occur in graphene.},

abstract = {Surface plasmons are collective oscillations of electrons in metals or semiconductors that enable confinement and control of electromagnetic energy at subwavelength scales. Rapid progress in plasmonics has largely relied on advances in device nano-fabrication, whereas less attention has been paid to the tunable properties of plasmonic media. One such medium--graphene--is amenable to convenient tuning of its electronic and optical properties by varying the applied voltage. Here, using infrared nano-imaging, we show that common graphene/SiO(2)/Si back-gated structures support propagating surface plasmons. The wavelength of graphene plasmons is of the order of 200 nanometres at technologically relevant infrared frequencies, and they can propagate several times this distance. We have succeeded in altering both the amplitude and the wavelength of these plasmons by varying the gate voltage. Using plasmon interferometry, we investigated losses in graphene by exploring real-space profiles of plasmon standing waves formed between the tip of our nano-probe and the edges of the samples. Plasmon dissipation quantified through this analysis is linked to the exotic electrodynamics of graphene. Standard plasmonic figures of merit of our tunable graphene devices surpass those of common metal-based structures.},

The implementation is based on the stretched coordinate form of the PML, a recursive convolution, and the use of complex frequency, shifted (CFS) PML parameters. The method, referred to here as the convolutional PML (CPML), offers a number of advantages over the traditional implementations of the PML. Specifically, the application of the CPML is completely independent of the host medium. Thus, no modifications are necessary when applying it to inhomogeneous, lossy, anisotropic, dispersive, or nonlinear media. Secondly, it is shown that the CFS–PML is highly absorptive of evanescent modes and can provide significant memory savings when computing the wave interaction of elongated structures, sharp corners, or low-frequency excitations. {\textcopyright} 2000 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.

abstract = {The sharpness of corners/edges can have a large effect on the optical responses of metallic nanostructures. Here we deploy the theory of transformation optics to analytically investigate a variety of blunt plasmonic structures, including overlapping nanowire dimers and crescent-shaped nanocylinders. These systems are shown to support several discrete optical modes, whose energy and line width can be controlled by tuning the nanoparticle geometry. In particular, the necessary conditions are highlighted respectively for the broadband light absorption effect and the invisibility dips that appear in the radiative spectrum. More detailed discussions are provided especially with respect to the structures with asymmetric edge rounding. These structures can support additional subradiant modes, whose interference with the neighboring dipolar modes results in a rapid change of the scattering cross-section, similar to the phenomenon observed in plasmonic Fano resonances. Finite element numerical calculations are also performed to validate the analytical predictions. The physical insights into blunt nanostructures presented in this work may be of great interest for the design of broadband light-harvesting devices, invisible and noninvasive biosensors, and slowing-light devices.},

@article{Davies2013,
abstract = {Owing to their ability to concentrate light on nanometer scales, plasmonic surface structures are ideally suited for on-chip functionalization with nonlinear or gain materials. However, achieving a high effective quantum yield across a surface requires not only strong light localization but also control over losses. Here, we report on a particular class of tunable low-loss metasurfaces featuring dense arrangements of nanometer-sized focal points on a photonic chip with an underlying waveguide channel. Guided within the plane, the photonic wave evanescently couples to the nanogaps, concentrating light in a lattice of hot-spots. In studying the energy transfer between photonic and plasmonic channels of single trimer molecules and triangular nanogap tilings in dependence on element size, we identify different regimes of operation. We show that the product of field enhancement, propagation length, and element size is close to constant in both the radiative and subwavelength regimes, opening pathways for device designs that combine high-field enhancements with large propagation lengths.},

The effects of electron-electron interactions in the dielectric response of the metal are taken into account through the implementation of a nonlocal, spatially dispersive, hydrodynamic permittivity. We demonstrate that spatial dispersion only slightly modifies the device parameters which maximize its field enhancement capabilities. The interplay between nonlocality, tip bluntness, and surface roughness is explored. We show that, although spatial dispersion reduces the field enhancement taking place at the structure apex, it also diminishes the impact that geometric imperfections have on its performance.},

@article{Dubinov2011,
abstract = {We analyze the surface plasmons (SPs) propagating along optically pumped single-graphene layer (SGL) and multiple-graphene layer (MGL) structures. It is shown that at sufficiently strong optical pumping when the real part of the dynamic conductivity of SGL and MGL structures becomes negative in the terahertz (THz) range of frequencies due to the interband population inversion, the damping of the THz SPs can give way to their amplification. This effect can be used in graphene-based THz lasers and other devices. Due to the relatively small SP group velocity, the absolute value of their absorption coefficient (SP gain) can be large, substantially exceeding that of optically pumped structures with dielectric waveguides. A comparison of SGL and MGL structures shows that to maximize the SP gain the number of graphene layers should be properly chosen.},

There are significant differences in behavior between the two systems and the behavior predicted for a classical two-dimensional sheet of electrons. In particular, the damping increases with wave vector independent of any obvious inelastic scattering channel. The results illustrate the importance of finite-momentum, nonlocal potential effects for the dynamical behavior of electri- cally isolated charge sheets.},

abstract = {We describe ultraresolution microscopy far beyond the classical Abbe diffraction limit of one half wavelength (lambda/2), and also beyond the practical limit (ca. lambda/10) of aperture-based scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM). The 'apertureless' SNOM discussed here uses light scattering from a sharp tip (hence scattering-type or s-SNOM) and has no lambda-related resolution limit. Rather, its resolution is approximately equal to the radius a of the probing tip (for commercial tips, a {\textless} 20 nm) so that 10 nm is obtained in the visible (lambda/60). A resolution of lambda/500 has been obtained in the mid-infrared at lambda = 10 microm. The advantage of infrared, terahertz and even microwave illumination is that specific excitations can be exploited to yield specific contrast, e.g. the molecular vibration offering a spectroscopic fingerprint to identify chemical composition. S-SNOM can routinely acquire simultaneous amplitude and phase images to obtain information on refractive and absorptive properties. Plasmon- or phonon-resonant materials can be highlighted by their particularly high near-field signal level. Furthermore, s-SNOM can map the characteristic optical eigenfields of small, optically resonant particles. Lastly, we describe theoretical modelling that explains and predicts s-SNOM contrast on the basis of the local dielectric function.},

@article{Chen2012,
abstract = {The ability to manipulate optical fields and the energy flow of light is central to modern information and communication technologies, as well as quantum information processing schemes. However, because photons do not possess charge, a way of controlling them efficiently by electrical means has so far proved elusive. A promising way to achieve electric control of light could be through plasmon polaritons—coupled excitations of photons and charge carriers—in graphene. In this two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms, it is expected that plasmon polaritons and their associated optical fields can readily be tuned electrically by varying the graphene carrier density. Although evidence of optical graphene plasmon resonances has recently been obtained spectroscopically, no experiments so far have directly resolved propagating plasmons in real space. Here we launch and detect propagating optical plasmons in tapered graphene nanostructures using near-field scattering microscopy with infrared excitation light. We provide real-space images of plasmon fields, and find that the extracted plasmon wavelength is very short—more than 40 times smaller than the wavelength of illumination. We exploit this strong optical field confinement to turn a graphene nanostructure into a tunable resonant plasmonic cavity with extremely small mode volume. The cavity resonance is controlled in situ by gating the graphene, and in particular, complete switching on and off of the plasmon modes is demonstrated, thus paving the way towards graphene-based optical transistors. This successful alliance between nanoelectronics and nano-optics enables the development of active subwavelength-scale optics and a plethora of nano-optoelectronic devices and functionalities, such as tunable metamaterials, nanoscale optical processing, and strongly enhanced light–matter interactions for quantum devices and biosensing applications.},

abstract = {The optical properties of graphene are made unique by the linear band structure and the vanishing density of states at the Dirac point. It has been proposed that even in the absence of a bandgap, a relaxation bottleneck at the Dirac point may allow for population inversion and lasing at arbitrarily long wavelengths. Furthermore, efficient carrier multiplication by impact ionization has been discussed in the context of light harvesting applications. However, all of these effects are difficult to test quantitatively by measuring the transient optical properties alone, as these only indirectly reflect the energy- and momentum-dependent carrier distributions. Here, we use time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with femtosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulses to directly probe the non-equilibrium response of Dirac electrons near the K-point of the Brillouin zone. In lightly hole-doped epitaxial graphene samples, we explore excitation in the mid- and near-infrared, both below and above the minimum photon energy for direct interband transitions. Whereas excitation in the mid-infrared results only in heating of the equilibrium carrier distribution, interband excitations give rise to population inversion, suggesting that terahertz lasing may be possible. However, in neither excitation regime do we find any indication of carrier multiplication, questioning the applicability of graphene for light harvesting.},

We observed composite "plasmaron" particles, which are bound states of charge carriers with plasmons, the density oscillations of the graphene electron gas. The Dirac crossing point is resolved into three crossings: the first between pure charge bands, the second between pure plasmaron bands, and the third a ring-shaped crossing between charge and plasmaron bands.},

Examples are the resistivity quantum, h/e2 (h is Planck's constant and e the electron charge), that appears in a variety of transport experiments and the magnetic flux quantum, h/e, playing an important role in the physics of superconductivity. By and large, sophisticated facilities and special measurement conditions are required to observe any of these phenomena. We show that the opacity of suspended graphene is defined solely by the fine structure constant, a = e2/hc � 1/137 (where c is the speed of light), the parameter that describes coupling between light and relativistic electrons and that is traditionally associated with quantum electrodynamics rather than materials science. Despite being only one atom thick, graphene is found to absorb a significant (pa = 2.3{\%}) fraction of incident white light, a consequence of graphene's unique electronic structure.},

To extend existing treatments of causality that work only in the frequency domain, I derive a reformulation of the long-standing Kramers–Kronig relations applicable not only to just temporal causality, but also to spacetime 'light-cone' causality based on signals carried by waves. I also apply this causal reasoning to Maxwell's equations, which is an instructive example since their causal properties are sometimes debated.},

@article{Sanchez2012,
abstract = {Graphene is a single-atom thick, two-dimensional sheet of hexagonally arranged carbon atoms isolated from its three-dimensional parent material, graphite. Related materials include few-layer-graphene (FLG), ultrathin graphite, graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and graphene nanosheets (GNS). This review proposes a systematic nomenclature for this set of Graphene-Family Nanomaterials (GFNs) and discusses specific materials properties relevant for biomolecular and cellular interactions. We discuss several unique modes of interaction between GFNs and nucleic acids, lipid bilayers, and conjugated small molecule drugs and dyes. Some GFNs are produced as dry powders using thermal exfoliation, and in these cases, inhalation is a likely route of human exposure. Some GFNs have aerodynamic sizes that can lead to inhalation and substantial deposition in the human respiratory tract, which may impair lung defense and clearance leading to the formation of granulomas and lung fibrosis. The limited literature on in vitro toxicity suggests that GFNs can be either benign or toxic to cells, and it is hypothesized that the biological response will vary across the material family depending on layer number, lateral size, stiffness, hydrophobicity, surface functionalization, and dose. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in target cells is a potential mechanism for toxicity, although the extremely high hydrophobic surface area of some GFNs may also lead to significant interactions with membrane lipids leading to direct physical toxicity or adsorption of biological molecules leading to indirect toxicity. Limited in vivo studies demonstrate systemic biodistribution and biopersistence of GFNs following intravenous delivery. Similar to other smooth, continuous, biopersistent implants or foreign bodies, GFNs have the potential to induce foreign body tumors. Long-term adverse health impacts must be considered in the design of GFNs for drug delivery, tissue engineering, and fluorescence-based biomolecular sensing. Future research is needed to explore fundamental biological responses to GFNs including systematic assessment of the physical and chemical material properties related to toxicity. Complete materials characterization and mechanistic toxicity studies are essential for safer design and manufacturing of GFNs in order to optimize biological applications with minimal risks for environmental health and safety.},

The breaking strength is 42 N m(-1) and represents the intrinsic strength of a defect-free sheet. These quantities correspond to a Young's modulus of E = 1.0 terapascals, third-order elastic stiffness of D = -2.0 terapascals, and intrinsic strength of sigma(int) = 130 gigapascals for bulk graphite. These experiments establish graphene as the strongest material ever measured, and show that atomically perfect nanoscale materials can be mechanically tested to deformations well beyond the linear regime.},

abstract = {We study the spatio-temporal dynamics of coherent amplification and lasing in planar gain-enhanced nanoplasmonic structures and show that a singularity in the density of optical states leads to a stopped-light feedback mechanism that allows for cavity-free photonic and surface-plasmon polariton nanolasing. We reveal that in the absence of cavity-induced feedback a phase-locked superposition of a quasi dispersion-free waveguide mode promotes the dynamic formation of a subwavelength lasing mode. Simulations on the basis of a full-time domain Maxwell-Bloch Langevin approach uncover a high spontaneous emission factor [small beta] [approximate] 0.9 and demonstrate that the stopped-light lasing/spasing mechanism is remarkably robust against interface roughness. Stopped-light surface-plasmon polariton lasing is shown to be stable for gain sections of a width of down to 200 nm but in wider gain structures of the order of 1 [small mu ]m the dynamics is characterised by spatio-temporally oscillating lasing surface-plasmon polaritons with typical temporal and spatial periods of smaller than 5 fs and smaller than 100 nm. Stopped-light lasing thus provides opportunities for ultrafast nanolasing and the realization of ultra-thin lasing surfaces and offers a new route to ultrafast spasing and cavity-free active quantum plasmonics.},

abstract = {Plasmons describe collective oscillations of electrons. They have a fundamental role in the dynamic responses of electron systems and form the basis of research into optical metamaterials. Plasmons of two-dimensional massless electrons, as present in graphene, show unusual behaviour that enables new tunable plasmonic metamaterials and, potentially, optoelectronic applications in the terahertz frequency range. Here we explore plasmon excitations in engineered graphene micro-ribbon arrays. We demonstrate that graphene plasmon resonances can be tuned over a broad terahertz frequency range by changing micro-ribbon width and in situ electrostatic doping. The ribbon width and carrier doping dependences of graphene plasmon frequency demonstrate power-law behaviour characteristic of two-dimensional massless Dirac electrons. The plasmon resonances have remarkably large oscillator strengths, resulting in prominent room-temperature optical absorption peaks. In comparison, plasmon absorption in a conventional two-dimensional electron gas was observed only at 4.2 K (refs 13, 14). The results represent a first look at light-plasmon coupling in graphene and point to potential graphene-based terahertz metamaterials.},

Such materials exhibit many unusual properties that are rarely or never observed in nature. They can be employed to realize useful functionalities in emerging metadevices based on light. Here, we review hyperbolic metamaterials [mdash] one of the most unusual classes of electromagnetic metamaterials. They display hyperbolic (or indefinite) dispersion, which originates from one of the principal components of their electric or magnetic effective tensor having the opposite sign to the other two principal components. Such anisotropic structured materials exhibit distinctive properties, including strong enhancement of spontaneous emission, diverging density of states, negative refraction and enhanced superlensing effects.},

abstract = {A finite three-dimensional photonic-crystal structure with a complete photonic bandgap is shown to drastically modify the spontaneous-emission rate of an embedded dipole. Calculations on the basis of the finite-difference time-domain method with perfectly matched layer boundary conditions demonstrate a strong position and polarization dependence of spontaneous emission within the unit cell. Strong enhancement effects are predicted at interfaces between the high-index and the low-index material. The inhibition of spontaneous emission within the bandgap is of the order of two magnitudes, even for relatively small crystallites.},

abstract = {The enzyme cofactors are intrinsically fluorescent and participate directly in the single molecule enzymology studies. Due to photobleaching, one cannot follow kinetics continuously by cofactor fluorescence for more than several minutes typically. Modification of spectral properties of fluorophores, such as the amplification of emission intensity, can be achieved through coupling with surface plasmons in close proximity to metallic nanostructures. This process, referred to as metal-enhanced fluorescence, offers promise for a range of applications, including bioassays, sensor technology, microarrays, and single-molecule studies. Here, we demonstrated up to a 100-fold increase in the emission of the single cofactors and flavoenzymes near silver nanostructures. Amplified fluorescence of different types of flavins and flavoenzymes has been interpreted by using time-resolved single molecule fluorescence data. The results show considerable promise for the studies of enzyme kinetics using the intrinsic fluorescence from the cofactors.},

abstract = {Spontaneous emission is not inherent to an emitter, but rather depends on its electromagnetic environment. In a microcavity, the spontaneous emission rate can be greatly enhanced compared with that in free space. This so-called Purcell effect can dramatically increase laser modulation speeds, although to date no time-domain measurements have demonstrated this. Here we show extremely fast photonic crystal nanocavity lasers with response times as short as a few picoseconds resulting from 75-fold spontaneous emission rate enhancement in the cavity. We demonstrate direct modulation speeds far exceeding 100 GHz (limited by the detector response time), already more than an order of magnitude above the fastest semiconductor lasers. Such ultrafast, efficient, and compact lasers show great promise for applications in high-speed communications, information processing, and on-chip optical interconnects.},

@article{Khurgin2005,
abstract = {The optical buffer is a key component in all-optical information processing systems. Recently a number of schemes that use slow light propagation in various media and structures have been proposed as means toward implementation of all-optical buffers. We rigorously analyze the similarities and differences in approaches that use electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and coupled resonant structures (CRS). We introduce the figure of merit, finesse, that is common to both approaches and obtain fundamental limitations on bit rates and storage capacities of optical buffers. We show that at very low bit rates and storage capacities EIT outperforms CRS, but at rates of 10 Mbits/s and above the EIT medium becomes quite inefficient, and the situation is reversed. Two types of CRS based on high-index-contrast fiber gratings and high-index semiconductor-air photonic crystals and (or) microring resonators are found to hold promise for applications in the 1-1000-Gbits/s range, but only if the losses can be drastically reduced.},

Artificial magnetism and negative refractive index are two specific types of behavior that have been demonstrated over the past few years, illustrating the new physics and new applications possible when we expand our view as to what constitutes a material. In this review, we describe recent advances in metamaterials research and discuss the potential that these materials may hold for realizing new and seemingly exotic electromagnetic phenomena.},

Now plasmonics researchers are turning their attention to photovoltaics, where design approaches based on plasmonics can be used to improve absorption in photovoltaic devices, permitting a considerable reduction in the physical thickness of solar photovoltaic absorber layers, and yielding new options for solar-cell design. In this review, we survey recent advances at the intersection of plasmonics and photovoltaics and offer an outlook on the future of solar cells based on these principles.},

Here the usual transfer matrix was modified to a generic form, with the ability to use the absolute squares of the Fresnel coefficients, so as to include incoherent (thick layers) and partially coherent (rough surface or interfaces) reflection and transmission. The method is integrated by use of models for refractive-index depth profiling. The utility of the method is illustrated with various multilayer structures formed by ion implantation into Si, including buried insulating and conducting layers, and multilayers with a thick incoherent layer in an arbitrary position.},

@article{Lakowicz2004,
abstract = {A new method of fluorescence detection that promises to increase sensitivity by 20- to 1000-fold is described. This method will also decrease the contribution of sample autofluorescence to the detected signal. The method depends on the coupling of excited fluorophores with the surface plasmon resonance present in thin metal films, typically silver and gold. The phenomenon of surface plasmon-coupled emission (SPCE) occurs for fluorophores 20–250 nm from the metal surface, allowing detection of fluorophores over substantial distances beyond the metal–sample interface. SPCE depends on interactions of the excited fluorophore with the metal surface. This interaction is independent of the mode of excitation; that is, it does not require evanescent wave or surface-plasmon excitation. In a sense, SPCE is the inverse process of the surface plasmon resonance absorption of thin metal films. Importantly, SPCE occurs over a narrow angular distribution, converting normally isotropic emission into easily collected directional emission. Up to 50{\%} of the emission from unoriented samples can be collected, much larger than typical fluorescence collection efficiencies near 1{\%} or less. SPCE is due only to fluorophores near the metal surface and may be regarded as emission from the induced surface plasmons. Autofluorescence from more distal parts of the sample is decreased due to decreased coupling. SPCE is highly polarized and autofluorescence can be further decreased by collecting only the polarized component or only the light propagating with the appropriate angle. Examples showing how simple optical configurations can be used in diagnostics, sensing, or biotechnology applications are presented. Surface plasmon-coupled emission is likely to find widespread applications throughout the biosciences.},

abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics (resulting from the merger of quantum mechanics and relativity theory) has provided a clear understanding of phenomena ranging from particle physics to cosmology and from astrophysics to quantum chemistry. The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective 'speed of light' c* approximately 10(6) m s(-1). Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass m(c) of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = m(c)c*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.},

abstract = {Metamaterials are artificially engineered structures that have properties, such as a negative refractive index, not attainable with naturally occurring materials. Negative-index metamaterials (NIMs) were first demonstrated for microwave frequencies, but it has been challenging to design NIMs for optical frequencies and they have so far been limited to optically thin samples because of significant fabrication challenges and strong energy dissipation in metals. Such thin structures are analogous to a monolayer of atoms, making it difficult to assign bulk properties such as the index of refraction. Negative refraction of surface plasmons was recently demonstrated but was confined to a two-dimensional waveguide. Three-dimensional (3D) optical metamaterials have come into focus recently, including the realization of negative refraction by using layered semiconductor metamaterials and a 3D magnetic metamaterial in the infrared frequencies; however, neither of these had a negative index of refraction. Here we report a 3D optical metamaterial having negative refractive index with a very high figure of merit of 3.5 (that is, low loss). This metamaterial is made of cascaded 'fishnet' structures, with a negative index existing over a broad spectral range. Moreover, it can readily be probed from free space, making it functional for optical devices. We construct a prism made of this optical NIM to demonstrate negative refractive index at optical frequencies, resulting unambiguously from the negative phase evolution of the wave propagating inside the metamaterial. Bulk optical metamaterials open up prospects for studies of 3D optical effects and applications associated with NIMs and zero-index materials such as reversed Doppler effect, superlenses, optical tunnelling devices, compact resonators and highly directional sources.},

@article{Liu2011,
abstract = {Integrated optical modulators with high modulation speed, small footprint and large optical bandwidth are poised to be the enabling devices for on-chip optical interconnects. Semiconductor modulators have therefore been heavily researched over the past few years. However, the device footprint of silicon-based modulators is of the order of millimetres, owing to its weak electro-optical properties. Germanium and compound semiconductors, on the other hand, face the major challenge of integration with existing silicon electronics and photonics platforms. Integrating silicon modulators with high-quality-factor optical resonators increases the modulation strength, but these devices suffer from intrinsic narrow bandwidth and require sophisticated optical design; they also have stringent fabrication requirements and limited temperature tolerances. Finding a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible material with adequate modulation speed and strength has therefore become a task of not only scientific interest, but also industrial importance. Here we experimentally demonstrate a broadband, high-speed, waveguide-integrated electroabsorption modulator based on monolayer graphene. By electrically tuning the Fermi level of the graphene sheet, we demonstrate modulation of the guided light at frequencies over 1 GHz, together with a broad operation spectrum that ranges from 1.35 to 1.6 µm under ambient conditions. The high modulation efficiency of graphene results in an active device area of merely 25 µm(2), which is among the smallest to date. This graphene-based optical modulation mechanism, with combined advantages of compact footprint, low operation voltage and ultrafast modulation speed across a broad range of wavelengths, can enable novel architectures for on-chip optical communications.},

abstract = {This review examines the properties of graphene from an experimental perspective. The intent is to review the most important experimental results at a level of detail ap- propriate for new graduate students who are interested in a general overview of the fascinating properties of graphene. While some introductory theoretical concepts are provided, including a discussion of the electronic band structure and phonon disper- sion, the main emphasis is on describing relevant experiments and important results as well as some of the novel applications of graphene. In particular, this review cov- ers graphene synthesis and characterization, field-effect behavior, electronic transport properties, magneto-transport, integer and fractional quantum Hall effects, mechanical properties, transistors, optoelectronics, graphene-based sensors, and biosensors. This approach attempts to highlight both the means by which the current understanding of graphene has come about and some tools for future contributions. PACS},
