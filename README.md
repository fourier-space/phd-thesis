# Surface Plasmon Emission and Dynamics in Active Planar Media
This repository is for the LaTeX and Image source files for my PhD Thesis,
*Surface Plasmon Emission and Dynamics in Active Planar Media*,
which was studied for at Imperial College London, 2011â€“2015 under the supervision of Prof. Ortwin Hess.
The thesis was examined on 18th January 2016 by Prof. Anatoly Zayats and Prof. Stefan Maier.

Since submitting the final version,
[available here](https://spiral.imperial.ac.uk/handle/10044/1/30760),
and during my time as a Research Associate I have made minor updates, using the thesis as a reference document for
[future work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OSjycdYAAAAJ&hl=en).
